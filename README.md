#### Video Demo: https://youtu.be/zD3DjHsvwQ4
#### Description:
##### my website (Boyla) is basically an **online shopping website** where you can sell cars or phones. Boyla can also recommend for you based on your budget that you type in or choose between the filters (all, type 1 (car), type 2 (phone), etc) from newest to oldest and if you liked an offer, then you can view the detalis like the amount of this item that the seller has, the price for each of this item, long description of the item that is written by the seller and of course the seller's profile so that you can contact the seller using his/her email or phone number.

##### you can also do basic actions like (**Login**, **Register**, **Change your password**) and the site will make sure that you are logged in, even if you register for the first time, you don't need to log in after that, **it's a waste of time**, because , Using flask, the website can already register you and if you typed in the wrong password, just go to the "change password" page and just change your password to whatever you want and don't worry because **Boyla** will make sure that your email password is in the right hands using what is called in cypersecurity as hashing!
